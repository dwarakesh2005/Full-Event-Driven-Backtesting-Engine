# Event-Driven Backtesting Engine

This project implements a quantitative event-driven backtesting engine from scratch.
The system is designed with strict time causality and clear separation between data,
strategy, portfolio, and execution components.

Initial focus is on correctness and architecture before adding realism and performance metrics.
